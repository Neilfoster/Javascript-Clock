# Javascript Clock
---

Javascript clock is a simple web application that displays the clock hands in real time, simulating a real life clock.

### Design 

This application uses minimal design using both HTML and Css to display a clock face

### Features

The main feature of this application is to display the current time on a clock face.
I created this application to practice my javascript skills that I have previously 
acquired.
